Hello dear player,

	Thank you very much for downloading this game, this is my first game there will be some form of inconsistencies and inconvieniences in the game and i apologize for them effecting the quality of the game :(..

	I really wish that you the player playing the game feel every detail in this game although it might not have much to offer but you can always critisize this game and give suggestion for the next game.I am really sorry but there would not be any updates for this game only a new game with different gameplay. Game offers information on controls but it misses on many aspects like how player health and stamina bars work.

sorry to be very demanding and informal but Please try to run the game on windows 8/10/11 for some reasons it just crashes on windows 7.
	
	This info can prove beneficial for every player so info of every player attribute bars are as follows:-
		red bar:- health bar,duh......
		blue bar:- to show how time remaining to be passed so that super jump can be used.
		green bar:- to show how much time remaining to be passed so that super sprint can be employed and upon trigger this bar will reduce and you will become normal once it depletes and the big circle in the HUD shows the red heart
		lime bar :- shows how much blessings of Lady Sunara is remaining (use them very wisely you only get 4 for every new game)
		orange bar:- show time remaining for the blessing to complete and you get a whole minute of blessing
		purple bar:- shows the level progress bar that correlates with your game score achieve the required score to pass a level.
		your score is displayed in the square section of the HUD
		
	controls are as follows:- 
		's' - to quick save the game
		'l' - to quick load the game
		'space' - to jump
		'double space' - to double jump
		'left control' - to super jump
		'double left shift' - to super sprint
		'h' - to call Lady Sunara to aid you

	In any level you might use right and left arrow keys or 'a' and 'd' to move left and right or forwards and backwards



	I know there is not much to offer in this game but if you like this let us work around building a healty community,the universe in this game is infant let us work together and make it beautiful for upcoming games and players :)

	you can always suggest me your ideas to implement and mistakes to fix in the next game at my mail(rishitselia@gmail.com)and i will try my best to implement them.
